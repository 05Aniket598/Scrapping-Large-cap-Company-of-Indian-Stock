# 📈 Large-Cap Stock Web Scraper (Practice Project)

This project is a **practice exercise** built after learning the basics of web scraping using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. The objective was to collect real-world stock data of **large-cap companies** to apply what I’ve learned during my Udemy course.

## 🔍 Data Scraped

The script scrapes the following data fields for each large-cap company:

- 🏷️ **Symbol** – Ticker symbol of the company  
- 🧾 **Name** – Full name of the company  
- 🏢 **Sector** – Industry classification  
- 💰 **Market Cap** – Market capitalization  
- 💵 **Price** – Current trading price  
- 📉 **Change** – Price change (absolute or %)  
- 📊 **Volume** – Daily trading volume  
- 📈 **P/E Ratio** – Price to Earnings Ratio  
- 🧠 **Analyst Rating** – Analyst opinion (Buy, Sell, Strong Buy/Sell, Neutral)

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Practice web scraping fundamentals using real-world finance data  
- Gain experience working with financial metrics and structured tabular data  
- Understand the data format and fields common in equity markets

---

## 💡 Why This Project?

Though this project is based on stock data (a finance-related theme), its **main purpose** is to **practice scraping techniques** — not to build a full-scale financial model yet.

---

## 📌 Tech Stack

- `requests`  
- `BeautifulSoup`  
- `pandas` (for data manipulation and preview)

---

## 📊 Analytics Added

In this project, I performed the following basic analyses:

- Displaying the **top companies by market capitalization**  
- Filtering companies based on **analyst ratings** such as Buy, Sell, Strong Buy, Strong Sell, and Neutral 
- Summarizing volume traded to identify the most actively traded stocks  

These are beginner-level analytics included to better understand the scraped data.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

As I continue learning tools like **Selenium** and **Scrapy**, I plan to:

- Scrape financial reports and key ratios  
- Build full **end-to-end analytics pipelines**  
- Focus future projects directly on the **finance domain**

> 🧪 This is a **practice project**, not domain-focused.
